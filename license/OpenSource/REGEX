 *
 * These routines are the PUBLIC DOMAIN equivalents of regex
 * routines as found in 4.nBSD UN*X, with minor extensions.
 *
 * These routines are derived from various implementations found
 * in software tools books, and Conroy's grep. They are NOT derived
 * from licensed/restricted software.
 * For more interesting/academic/complicated implementations,
 * see Henry Spencer's regexp routines, or GNU Emacs pattern
 * matching module.
 * Modification history:
 *
 * $Log: regex.c,v $
 * Revision 1.4  1991/10/17  03:56:42  oz
 * miscellaneous changes, small cleanups etc.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  1989/04/01  14:18:09  oz
 * Change all references to a dfa: this is actually an nfa.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  88/08/28  15:36:04  oz
 * Use a complement bitmap to represent NCL.
 * This removes the need to have seperate
 * code in the pmatch case block - it is
 * just CCL code now.
